## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

To set the working directory
```{r}
setwd('~/Documents/udacity-eda-course-materials/lesson3/')
```
To view the list of files in the directory

```{r}
list.files()
```

To load the data
```{r}
pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv', sep = '\t')
```

To view the column names and the corresponding data types
```{r}
str(pf)
```

To view the list of column names in the data frame
```{r}
names(pf)
```

To view the dimension alias shape of a data frame
```{r}
dim(pf)
```

To view the summary of the data (displays counts for factor/categorical variables; min, mean, max, and quantiles for numerical data)

```{r}
summary(pf)
```

To view the count of factor variable

```{r}
table(pf$gender)
```

To view the levels of a categorical variable
```{r}
levels(pf$gender)
```

To order the factor variables
```{r}
pf$gender <- factor(pf$gender, levels = c('male', 'female'), ordered = T)

# or the below way

pf$gender <- ordered(pf$gender, levels = c('male', 'female'))
```

To plot the distributions of the variables
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data = pf, x = age)
# or the below way
qplot(data = pf, x = dob_day) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:31) +
  facet_wrap(~dob_month, ncol = 4)

# facet_wrap is for 1 categorical variable facet_wrap(~variable)
# facet_grid is for more than one variable facet_grid(vertical ~ horizontal)

qplot(data = pf, x = friend_count, xlim = c(0,1000))

qplot(data = pf, x = friend_count, binwidth = 25) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
  #facet_grid(gender ~ .)
```

To omit N/A data

```{r}
na.omit(pf)
```

To subset non-na data
```{r}
subsetpf <- subset(pf, !is.na(gender))
```

To plot distribution with facet and ignoring the na values
```{r}
qplot(data = subsetpf, x = friend_count, binwidth = 10) + facet_grid(gender ~ .)
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(0:1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) 
```

```{r}
table(pf$gender)
by(pf$friend_count, pf$gender, summary)
```

```{r}
qplot(data = pf, x = tenure/365, color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9'), binwidth = 0.25, xlab = 'Number of years using facebook', ylab = 'Number of users in Sample') +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,7), breaks = seq(0,7,1))
```

```{r}
qplot(x = age, data = pf, binwidth = 1, color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9')) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(10, 113), breaks = seq(10, 113, 10))
```

Transforming the data
```{r}
p1 = qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf)
p2 = qplot(x = log10(friend_count + 1), data = pf)  
p3 = qplot(x = sqrt(friend_count), data = pf) 
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3, ncol = 1)


p1 <- ggplot(aes(x = friend_count), data = pf) + geom_histogram()
p2 <- p1 + scale_x_log10()
p3 <- p1 + scale_x_sqrt()
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3, ncol = 1)
```

Frequency Polygons - (density)
```{r}

#counts

# though it seems like male have higher friend count, majority of the males of have lower friend count compared to females. In the right end tail female friend_count over take males 
# changed the limits to take a closer view of when females over take male count
qplot(x = friend_count, y = ..count../sum(..count..), data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), binwidth = 10, geom = 'freqpoly', color = gender)+

Frequency Polygon - to see which gender has majority likes

qplot(x = likes, data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)))+ scale_x_log10()

qplot(x = likes, data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)))+ scale_x_sqrt()

Number of www_likes count for male and female
```{r}

box_plot

      geom = 'boxplot') +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1000))

# below plot is different from above 2 plots, the above ones will consider only the data between 0 and 1000 friend_count, where as this one considers entire data but visually represents only 0-1000 count

      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)),
      geom = 'boxplot') +

On an average who made more friendship requests men or women?

by(pf$friendships_initiated, pf$gender, summary)
```

```{r}
summary(pf$mobile_likes)

summary(pf$mobile_likes > 0)

pf$mobile_check_in <- NA
